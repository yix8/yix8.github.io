## About Me
I am currently a Master student in Machine Learning at [Dark Lab](https://ucldark.com/), [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), supervised by [Tim Rockt√§schel](https://rockt.github.io/).

Previously, I completed my Bachelor in Computing and Software Systems at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/). Following that, I obtained my first Master degree in Computing Science from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/).

I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to explore research directions related to Large Language Models.
